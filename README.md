# triode-emulation
Graduate thesis to obtain the Electrical Engineer degree which proposes an analog discrete circuit to emulate triode gain stage. 

This work firstly focuses in experimentally exploring the pre-amplification stage of a Fender Champ guitar amplifier with the objective of characterizing the harmonic content of the output signal. This stage consists in a single 12AX7 common cathode preamplifier, and three different triode brands are tested to better describe the harmonics.  Then, based on these findings, a discrete and analog circuit is proposed that emulates this gain stage. This circuit has fundamental parameters that allow to shape the transfer curve of the stage.
